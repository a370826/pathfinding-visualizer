# Interactive Path Finder

I created a visualization tool for popular A* pathfinding algorithm. It current supports addings obstacles and moving endpoints. <br/>

Python 3 and the pygame library must be installed to be able to run this code. <br/>
To install pygame, go to the command line and type:<br/>
Windows: py -m pip install -U pygame --user<br/>
Mac: python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user<br/>
